1. What is Spring boot?
=> Spring boot is a framework for building application in the java programming language.
spring boot provide us tools with we can build application in java language

=> Spring boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade spring based application
that you can just run 
=> The core spring framework already reduces boilerplate code and provide a lot of helpful
features for java application. However, Spring boot takes this convenience to the next level
by focusing specifically on reducing the effort required to set up and configure a spring
application.
=> While spring boot simplify many tasks like creating web applications, working with database,
managing database and many more. But setting up a spring project can still involve quite a bit
of manual configuration. 
=> This is where spring boot steps in 
    i. Auto-configuration 
    ii. Standalone application 
=> we use the @SpringBootApplication annotation on the main class. This single annotation replace
the need for setting up a manually Spring application context.
=> We use SpringApplication.run() to start the application and spring boot takes care of configuring
the embedded web servers and other necessary components.
=> The @SpringBootApplication annotation alone brings in a lot of pre-configured features, including 
automatic component scanning and embedded sever configuration which would have required more steps
in a traditional Spring setup.
